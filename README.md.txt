# Python Control Flow Assignment

This project demonstrates the use of Python control flow concepts including:

- if / elif / else statements
- for loops
- while loops
- break and continue statements
- Input validation

## Tasks Implemented

### Task 1: Discount Rules
- Accepts user input for order amount
- Applies discount based on predefined rules
- Handles invalid (non-numeric) input

### Task 2: Process Multiple Orders
- Uses a for loop to apply discounts to multiple orders
- Calculates total revenue after discounts
- Counts number of discounted orders

### Task 3: User Menu
- Implements a while-loop driven menu
- Allows adding orders
- Displays total after discounts
- Uses break and continue appropriately

### Task 5: Loop Control
- Processes daily sales data
- Uses break for corrupted data
- Uses continue for zero sales days
- Calculates running and final totals
